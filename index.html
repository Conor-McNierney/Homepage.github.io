<p>Most interesting thing I have done is Occulus Rift development for real world movement tracking. Mainly coded in C and I was in charge of getting the data from the sensors, putting all the data in one place. Then calculating the gait or walking speed of the person wearing the sensor, using that to determine speed in the VR headset.
